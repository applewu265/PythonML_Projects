### Ongoing and Finished Machine Learning Projects
Author: Apple Wu

**Project 1: Median Housing Price Prediction (Finalizing)**
* Objective: predict median house prices from related features (e.g. median income, household, longitude, latitude, etc.)
* Used the California Housing Prices dataset from Statlib (based on 1990 California census)
* Applied custom transformations and preprocessing to data
* Optimized RandomForest model to predict housing prices
* (Primarily for learning purposes)

**Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction (Finalizing)**
* Objective: predict if a patient has heart disease from related features (e.g. age,  cholesterol, cp, etc.)
* Used UCI Heart Dataset from Kaggle (priyanka841/heart-disease-prediction-uci)
* Trained multiple models to predict heart disease, chose RandomForest

**Project 3: MNIST Classifier (Finalizing)**
* Objective: to train and evaluate various ML models to classify the MNIST dataset
* Trained SVC and RandomForest as binary classifiers and as multiclass classifiers
* Trained KNN as multioutput multiclass classifier to remove added noise from MNIST images
* Model evaluation in progress
* (Primarily for learning purposes)

**Project 4: Hospital Readmission Prediction (In Progress)**
* Objective: to predict whether a diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge
* Using Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008 dataset from UCI ML repository
